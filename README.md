<summary>additions</summary>

### How to Use the Additions Bot Commands

> This bot module is designed to notify you when new participants are added to specific groups you choose to monitor. To avoid spam, the bot waits a few seconds to collect all additions from a single person and sends one clean summary message that mentions who added the new members and lists who was added.

**Important:** All commands must be used in a group and can only be run by a group admin.

***

#### ➡️ `additiongroup <group_jid> [...]`

> This command tells the bot to **start monitoring** one or more groups for new additions. You can add multiple groups at once by separating their JIDs with a space or by providing them on separate lines.

> Turn on or off

```bash
additions on
```

* **Usage 1 (single line)**: Type `additiongroup` followed by the full JIDs of the groups you want to monitor.
* **Example**: `additiongroup 120300123456789012@g.us 120300987654321012@g.us`
* **Usage 2 (multi-line)**: Type `additiongroup` on the first line, then enter the JIDs on subsequent lines.
* **Example**:

```bash
    additiongroup
    120300123456789012@g.us
    120300987654321012@g.us
```

---

```bash
deladditiongroup <group_jid|index> [...]
```

```bash
removeadditiongroup <group_jid|index> [...]
```
> This command tells the bot to **stop monitoring** one or more groups. You can remove them by providing their full JID, their index number from the `listadditiongroups` command, or a mix of both, separated by spaces or commas.

* **Usage**: Type `deladditiongroup` or `removeadditiongroup` followed by the JID(s) or index number(s) to remove.
* **Example (by JID)**: `deladditiongroup 120300123456789012@g.us`
* **Example (by index)**: `deladditiongroup 2 4`
* **Example (mixed)**: `deladditiongroup 1 120300987654321012@g.us`

---

#### ➡️ `listadditiongroups` / `additiongroups`

> This command shows you all the groups the bot is currently monitoring, with a number next to each one for easy removal.

* **Usage**: Simply type `listadditiongroups` or `additiongroups`.
* **Example**: `listadditiongroups`

---

#### ➡️ `additions on|off`
```bash
additions on
additions off
```

> This command is a global toggle to **enable or disable** the entire additions notification system.

* **Usage**: Type `additions on` to turn it on or `additions off` to turn it off.
* **Example**: 
```bash
additions off
```

---

#### ➡️ `additiontarget <target_jid|clear>`

> This command sets a specific chat or group where **all** additions notifications will be sent. By default, notifications are sent to the group where the addition happened.

* **Usage**: Type `additiontarget` followed by the JID of the target chat. Use `clear` to revert to the default behavior.
* **Example**: `additiontarget 120300987654321012@g.us`
* **Example to clear**:
```bash
additiontarget clear
```

---

  <summary>alive</summary>

### How to Use the Alive Bot Commands

> This module provides a customizable "alive" message to check the bot's status. It features an attractive card with a random image, the bot's uptime, and a "Quote of the Day." Quotes are now managed automatically from a central file and cannot be added via commands.

**Important: Usage Modes**

This module has two ways to use commands:
1.  **Group Usage:** Commands are run by **group admins** directly inside a group. They affect only the group where the command is used.
2.  **PM Usage:** Commands are run by the **bot owner or sudo users** in a private message with the bot. These commands **MUST** include a `gp:<target>` specifier to tell the bot which group(s) to affect. The target can be a group's alias, its JID, or `all` for every group.

***

#### ➡️ `alive`

> Manually sends the alive message.

* **Group Usage**:
    * `alive`: Sends the alive message to the current group.
    * `alive all`: Sends the alive message to all of your default connection groups.
* **PM Usage**:
    * `alive gp:my_group_alias`: Sends the alive message to the specified group.
    * `alive gp:all`: Sends the alive message to all groups the bot is in.

---

#### ➡️ `setalive`

> Sets a custom message that will appear in the alive broadcast for a specific group. This supports multi-line text.

* **Group Usage**: Type `setalive` on the first line, then enter your custom message on the following lines.
* **Example (in a group)**:
```bash
    setalive
    This is my group's
    custom alive text!
```

* **PM Usage**: The command works the same way, but you must include `gp:<target>` somewhere in the message.
* **Example (in PM)**:

```bash
    setalive
    This is the new message.
    gp:my_group_alias
```

---

#### ➡️ `delalive`

> Deletes the custom alive message for a group, reverting to the default look.

* **Group Usage**: `delalive`
* **PM Usage**: `delalive gp:my_group_alias`

---

#### ➡️ `alivedaily`

> Manages the automatic daily sending of the alive message for a group.

* **Group Usage**:
    * `alivedaily`: Shows the current daily status for this group.
    * `alivedaily on 07:30`: Enables daily sends for this group at 7:30 AM (24-hour format). Time is optional and defaults to `08:00`.
    * `alivedaily off`: Disables daily sends for this group.
* **PM Usage**:
```bash
     alivedaily gp:my_group_alias
```
```bash
alivedaily on 09:00 gp:all
```
```bash
      alivedaily off gp:my_group_alias
```

---

#### ➡️ `listquote`

> Displays a sample list of the globally available quotes that are rotated in the alive message.

* **Usage**: Simply type `listquote`. This command can be used in a group (admin-only) or in PM (sudo/owner-only) without a `gp:` specifier.
* **Example**: 
```bash
listquote
```

**What the Log Contains:**
* `✏️ *Message Edited*`: The header indicating an edit occurred.
* `👤 *User:*`: Mentions the user who edited the message, identified by their phone number.
* `💬 *Chat:*`: Shows the group name and JID where the message was edited.
* `🆔 *Message ID:*`: The unique ID of the message that was changed.
* `🔁 *Original Message:*`: A copy of the message content *before* the edit. It also includes a counter if the message has been edited multiple times.
* `✏️ *Edited To:*`: The new message content *after* the edit.

  <summary>antiviewonce</summary>

### How to Use the Anti-Viewonce Module

This module helps you save "view-once" images and videos. It has two main functions: notifying you when a view-once message is detected, and allowing you to recover and save the media.

***

#### How to Recover a View-Once Message

> The recovery process is done by replying to the message you want to save.

1.  Someone sends a view-once message in a chat.
2.  To save it, **reply** directly to that view-once message.
3.  Your reply message **must start with an underscore (`_`)**. The rest of the message doesn't matter. You can simply reply with `_`.
4.  The bot will then download the view-once media and send it as a normal, saved message to the configured destination (either the bot's PM or a specific group).

***

#### Commands

> Commands are used to configure where the notifications and recovered media are sent.

**Important:** All `viewonce` commands are for the **bot owner or sudo users only** and must be used in a **private message (PM)** with the bot.

#### ➡️ `viewonce`

> This is the main command for managing settings.

* **Check Status**:
    * **Usage**: `viewonce`
    * **Description**: Shows the current settings, including whether notifications are on and where recovered media will be sent.

* **Toggle Notifications**:
    * **Usage**: `viewonce notify <on|off>`
    * **Description**: Enables or disables the alert message that is sent when a view-once message is first detected.
    * **Example**: `viewonce notify on`

* **Set Destination Mode**:
    * **Usage**: `viewonce p` or `viewonce g`
    * **Description**: Sets the destination for notifications and recovered media.
        * `p` (or `pm`): Sends everything to the bot's private chat.
        * `g` (or `group`): Sends everything to a specific group. You must set the target JID for this to work.

* **Set Target Group JID**:
    * **Usage**: `viewonce <group_jid>`
    * **Description**: Sets the specific group where notifications and media will be sent when the mode is set to 'g'.
    * **Example**: `viewonce 120363043812345678@g.us`

  <summary>filter</summary>

### How to Use the Filter Module (gfilter)

> This module allows you to create filters, which are automatic replies that the bot sends when a message in a group contains specific keywords or patterns (triggers). Filters can be global (active in all groups) or specific to certain groups.

***

#### How It Works & Permissions

> > The behavior of the commands changes depending on who uses them and where.

* **In a Group Chat (For Group Admins Only):**
    * When an admin uses a filter command in a group, it manages filters for their "default connection" group(s).
    * Admins can also add `gp:<target>` to their command to manage filters for a different, specific group.

* **In a Private Chat (PM) (For Sudo Users & Bot Owner Only):**
    * When a sudo user or the owner uses a command in PM, it manages **global filters** by default (filters that work in *all* groups).
    * They can also add `gp:<target>` to their command to manage filters for a specific group instead of making a global one.

***

#### Commands

#### ➡️ `gfilter` (Create or Update a Filter)

> This command sets up a new filter or overwrites an existing one.

* **Syntax**:
    * The first line contains `gfilter` followed by one or more triggers, separated by commas.
    * The following lines contain the response(s). Each new response must start with a `!`.

* **Example 1: Single Trigger, Single Response**
    ```
    gfilter hello
    !Hi there! How can I help you?
    ```

* **Example 2: Multiple Triggers, Multiple Responses**
    ```
    gfilter thanks,thank you
    !You're welcome!
    !No problem at all.
    ```

* **Example 3: Targeting a Specific Group (using `gp`)**
    ```
    gfilter info
    !Here is the info for the tech group.
    gp:tech_group_alias
    ```

---

#### ➡️ `glistfilter` (List All Filters)

> This command shows all the active filter triggers.

* **Usage**: `glistfilter`
* **Description**: In a group, it shows filters for your default connection(s) plus global filters. In PM, it shows global filters by default.
* **Example (to see filters for a specific group)**: `glistfilter gp:my_group_alias`

---

#### ➡️ `gdelfilter` (Delete a Filter)

> This command removes one or more filters.
*Aliases: `gdelfilters`, `gdelf`*

* **Usage**: `gdelfilter <trigger1,trigger2,...>`
* **Description**: Deletes the specified filter trigger(s).
* **Example**: `gdelfilter hello,thanks`

* **Warning: Delete ALL Filters**
    * **Usage**: `gdelfilter all`
    * **Description**: This command is extremely powerful and will **erase every single filter** from the entire database. Use with extreme caution.

---

#### Advanced Matching

> Besides exact words, you can use advanced patterns for triggers.

* **Wildcard (`*`)**: The `*` acts as a placeholder for any characters.
    * **Example**: A trigger of `go*d` would match "good", "gold", and "goood".

* **Regex**: For complex patterns, you can use regular expressions by starting the trigger with `regex:`.
    * **Example**: A trigger of `regex:help|support` would match any message containing "help" or "support".

  <summary>welcome</summary>

### How to Use the Welcome Module

This module automatically greets new members with a customizable, visually appealing welcome card when they join a group.

***

#### The Welcome Card
When a new user joins, the bot will send a message that includes:
* A card-style background.
* The new member's profile picture as a thumbnail (or a random welcome image if the profile picture is unavailable).
* A mention of the new user.
* The group's name.
* Your custom welcome message.
* The new total member count (e.g., `YOU'RE MEMBER: 51/1025`).

To keep the chat clean, the bot will also attempt to delete the previously sent welcome message when a new one is posted.

***

#### Permissions & How to Target Groups

* **Permissions**: All commands can only be used by **group admins** and must be sent in a group chat.
* **Default Targeting**: When an admin uses a command, it will apply to their "default connection" group(s).
* **Specific Targeting**: To manage the welcome message for a different group, include `gp:<target>` in your command, where `<target>` is a group alias or JID.

***

#### Commands

##### ➡️ `wlc` (Set Welcome Message)
This command sets or updates the main body of the welcome message for the target group(s). The greeting and member count are added automatically.

* **Example (for default connection)**:
    ```
    wlc
    Please read the group rules in the description.
    We look forward to your participation!
    ```

* **Example (for a specific group)**:
    ```
    wlc
    This is the welcome message for the dev team.
    gp:dev_team_alias
    ```

---

##### ➡️ `delwlc` (Delete Welcome Message)
This command deletes the welcome message configuration for the target group(s), effectively disabling the welcome feature for them.
