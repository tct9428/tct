📅 *Scheduler Manual & Usage Guide*

Below is a complete guide on how to automate messages using the `sched` command.

_Note: If using these commands inside a specific group, the bot defaults to that group. If sending from DM/Private Chat, you must specify the target group using the extension format (e.g., `jd:groupName` or `jd:123456@g.us`)._

---

*1. Create a Daily Recurring Schedule*
Use this to set a message that repeats every day at a specific time.

`sched add HH:mm <message>`

> • *Example:* `sched add 08:30 Good Morning Team!`
> • _Explanation:_ Sends "Good Morning Team!" every day at 8:30 AM.

---

*2. Create a One-Time Schedule (Specific Date)*
Use this to schedule a message for a specific calendar date. Note the pipe `|` separator.

`sched add YYYY-MM-DD|HH:mm <message>`

> • *Example:* `sched add 2025-12-25|00:00 Merry Christmas!`
> • _Explanation:_ Sends the message exactly at midnight on Christmas, then stops.

---

*3. Create a One-Time Schedule (Next Occurrence)*
Use this to send a message the _next_ time the clock hits this time, but do not repeat it afterwards.

`sched once HH:mm <message>`

> • *Example:* `sched once 14:00 Remind me to call John`
> • _Explanation:_ If it is currently 13:00, this runs today at 14:00. If it is 15:00, it runs tomorrow at 14:00. It runs only once.

---

*4. Schedule by Relative Time (Countdown)*
Use this to send a message after a specific duration from now. Units: `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days).

`sched in <number> <unit> <message>`

> • *Example:* `sched in 45 m Laundry is done`
> • _Explanation:_ Sends the notification exactly 45 minutes from now.
> • *Example:* `sched in 2 d Follow up on report`

---

*5. Managing Schedules*

*View Active Schedules*
`sched list`
> • Displays a list of all schedules with their *ID number* (used for editing/deleting).

*Delete a Schedule*
`sched delete <ID>`
> • *Example:* `sched delete 2`
> • _Explanation:_ Permanently removes schedule #2.
> • *Example:* `sched delete all` (Removes everything).

*Pause/Resume a Schedule*
`sched off <ID>` or `sched on <ID>`
> • *Example:* `sched off 1`
> • _Explanation:_ The schedule exists but will ~not trigger~ until you turn it back `on`.

---

*6. Advanced Editing*

*Change the Time*
`sched edit <ID> <NewTime>`
> • *Example:* `sched edit 1 09:00`
> • _Explanation:_ Updates schedule #1 to trigger at 9:00 instead of its previous time.

*Change Frequency (Days)*
By default, recurring schedules run every 1 day. You can change this interval.
`sched freq <ID> <Days>`

> • *Example:* `sched freq 1 7`
> • _Explanation:_ Makes schedule #1 run once a week (every 7 days).

---

*7. Using Extensions (Targeting)*
When you are not in the group, use the bot's extension prefix to target specific chats.

`jd:myGroup sched list`
> • Lists schedules for the group named "myGroup".

`jd:all sched add 12:00 Lunch Time`
> • Adds this schedule to *all* groups the bot is managing.
