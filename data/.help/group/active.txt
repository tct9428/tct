📊 *Activity Tracker Manual*

This module automatically tracks how many messages members send in the group to create "Top Chatter" leaderboards.

_Note: The bot automatically tracks activity in the background. It filters out spam by ignoring duplicate messages sent too quickly._

• lastactive jd:all  
  _Displays the previous week's stats for all groups the bot manages (results may be large)._
