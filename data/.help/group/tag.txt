🏷️  *Tag Everyone Manual*

This module allows admins to mention (tag) every single member in the group with individual notifications.

_Note: This command only works inside groups and is restricted to Admins._

⊷═══════════════════⊷

*1. Verbose Tag (Visible List)*
Use double `@@` followed by a space to tag everyone with individual notifications and display all tagged members.

`@@ <message>`

> • *Example:* `@@ ATTENTION REQUIRED`
> • _Explanation:_ Every member receives an individual notification showing they were personally mentioned. The bot also appends a list of all tagged members to the message.

*How Bot Tagging Works:*

• Each member receives an *individual mention notification* (not a generic "mentioned all")
• Higher engagement as members see they were tagged personally
• Works in groups where @all feature may be restricted

*Usage Rules:*
• Must include space: `@@ message` ✓
• No space: `@@message` ✗ (won't work)
• Only group admins can use this command

*Note: WhatsApp provides @ll for group-wide mentions, but this bot tagging gives individual notifications to each member.*
