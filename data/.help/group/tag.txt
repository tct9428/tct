🏷️ *Tag Everyone Manual*

This module allows admins to mention (tag) every single member in the group at once. It is useful for important announcements.

_Note: This command only works inside groups and is restricted to Admins._

⊷═══════════════════⊷

*1. Ghost Tag (Hidden List)*
Use a single `@` followed by a space to tag everyone without cluttering the chat. The members will get a notification, but they won't see a giant list of phone numbers.

`@ <message>`

> • *Example:* `@ Good morning everyone!`
> • _Explanation:_ Every member gets a ping, but the message just looks like "Good morning everyone!".

•═══════════════════•

*2. Verbose Tag (Visible List)*
Use double `@@` followed by a space if you want to explicitly list every member's name/number in the message body.

`@@ <message>`

> • *Example:* `@@ ATTENTION REQUIRED`
> • _Explanation:_ Every member is pinged, and the bot appends a long list of "@John @Mary @123..." at the bottom of your message.
