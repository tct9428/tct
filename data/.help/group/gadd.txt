📝 *GAdd (Global Event Logger) Manual*

This module is a monitoring tool for Bot Owners. It tracks every user who joins, leaves, is added, or is kicked from *any* group the bot is in, and sends a summary report to a specific log channel (Target).

_Note: This command is restricted to the Bot Owner and Sudo users._

⊷═══════════════════⊷

*1. Setting the Log Target*
Before enabling the module, you must tell the bot *where* to send the reports. This is usually your private ID or a dedicated log group ID.

`.gadd <JID>`

> • *Example:* `.gadd 12036302392@g.us`
> • _Explanation:_ Tells the bot to send all join/leave logs to this specific group ID.

•═══════════════════•

*2. Enabling or Disabling*
Turn the monitoring system on or off.

`.gadd on`
> • _Explanation:_ Starts tracking events. If 10 people join a group rapidly, the bot will bundle them into one report and send it to your target.

`.gadd off`
> • _Explanation:_ Stops tracking.

⊷═══════════════════⊷

*3. Checking Status*
View the current configuration to see if it is running and where the logs are going.

`.gadd` or `.gadd status`

> • _Output:_ Shows `🟢 ON` or `🔴 OFF` and the current Target JID.

•═══════════════════•

*4. Understanding the Report*
The bot waits a few seconds (debounces) to gather multiple events into one message to avoid spamming your log channel.

*The report includes:*
> • *Group Name:* Which group the events happened in.
> • *Joins:* Users who joined via invite link.
> • *Adds:* Users added by an admin (shows *who* added them).
> • *Leaves:* Users who left on their own.
> • *Kicks:* Users removed by an admin (shows *who* kicked them).
