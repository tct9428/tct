👢 *Kick Module Manual*

This module provides quick moderation tools to remove users from your group. It includes fun "kick messages" that cycle through different phrases when removing someone.

_Note: You must be a Group Admin to use these commands. The bot also needs to be an Admin to actually remove people._

*1. Kick by Reply*
The easiest way to remove a user. Just reply to their message.

`.kick`

> • *Usage:* Reply to a specific message sent by the trouble-maker with `.kick`.
> • _Action:_ The bot kicks the sender of that message immediately.

•═══════════════════•

*2. Kick by Mention*
Remove a user by tagging them in the command.

`.kick @user`

> • *Example:* `.kick @John`
> • _Action:_ Removes John from the group.

•═══════════════════•

*3. Kick by Number*
Remove a user by typing their phone number directly (useful if they have already left or you can't tag them).

`.kick <number>`

> • *Example:* `.kick 254712345678`
> • _Action:_ Kicks the user with that specific phone number.

*4. Kick All (Mass Clean)*
A dangerous command that attempts to empty the group.

`.kick all`

> • _Explanation:_ Starts a process to kick *everyone* in the group.
> • _Safety:_ The bot will ask for confirmation. You must reply with `yes` or `.kick yes` to proceed.
> • _Note:_ This command **skips admins**. It will remove all normal members but leave the admins (and the bot) inside.
