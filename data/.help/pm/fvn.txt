🎤 *FVN (Fake Voice Note) Manual*

This module allows you to convert any audio file (songs, recorded clips, forwarded audio) into a "real" WhatsApp Voice Note (PTT).
When sent, it appears with the green microphone icon and waveform, looking exactly like a directly recorded voice message.

_Note: This command is restricted to the Bot Owner and Sudo users. It works in Private Messages (PM) only._
