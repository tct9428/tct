♻️ *Anti-Status Delete Manual*

This module is a surveillance tool for WhatsApp Statuses. It automatically saves every status update your contacts post. If a contact *deletes* their status, the bot recovers it and forwards it to your log channel.

_Note: This command is restricted to the Bot Owner and Sudo users._

✦═════════◆═════════✦

*1. Enable or Disable*
Turn the status monitoring system on or off.

`.asd on`
> • _Explanation:_ Starts monitoring statuses. If someone deletes a status, the bot will recover and repost it.

`.asd off`
> • _Explanation:_ Stops monitoring.

✦═════════◆═════════✦

*2. Where do the statuses go?*
This module shares the same "Target" as the *Antidelete* module.
> • If you have set a target using `.dlt <JID>`, recovered statuses will be sent there.
> • If no target is set, they will be sent to the Bot's Private Chat (Saved Messages).

✦═════════◆═════════✦

*3. Checking Status*
See if the monitor is currently running.

`.asd`

> • _Output:_ Shows `🟢 ON` or `🔴 OFF`.

✦═════════◆═════════✦

*4. How it Works*
> • *Capture:* The bot silently downloads images, videos, and text statuses as soon as they appear on your WhatsApp.
> • *Storage:* It keeps them temporarily for 24 hours (since statuses expire anyway).
> • *Recovery:* If the user hits "Delete" on their status before 24 hours are up, the bot immediately sends the saved file to your log channel with the caption: *"♻️ Status Recovered"*.
