⏩ *Forwarder (Broadcast) Manual*

_This module allows you to send a single message to multiple groups or users simultaneously._
_It automatically cleans the message (removing the command and routing tags) so it looks like a direct, manual message in the destination chat._

_Note: This command is restricted to the Bot Owner/Sudo and must be used in Private Chat (PM)._

•════════◄►════════•

*1. Basic Usage*
Type the command, your message, and the destination tag in one block.

`.fwd <Message> jd:<Target>`

> • *Example:*
> `.fwd Hello everyone! This is an announcement. jd:Support`
>
> • _Explanation:_
> The bot sends "Hello everyone! This is an announcement." to the "Support" group.
> The `.fwd` and `jd:Support` parts are removed; they do not appear in the final message.

•════════◄►════════•

*2. Mass Broadcast (All Groups)*
Send a message to every group in your JIDBook.

`.fwd <Message> jd:all`

> • *Example:*
> `.fwd Maintenance starting in 10 minutes. jd:all`
>
> • _Explanation:_
> Sends the maintenance warning to *all* managed groups.

*3. Human-Like Behavior*
This module is designed to look natural and avoid spam filters.

> • *Typing Simulation:* The bot shows "Typing..." in the target group before sending.
> • *Safety Delay:* It waits slightly between sends (250ms) to prevent getting banned for flooding.

•════════◄►════════•

*4. Advanced Formatting*
You can put the routing tag on a separate line for clarity.

> • *Example:*
> `.fwd`
> `Here is the update for today.`
> `Please read carefully.`
> `jd:Devs`

> • _Result:_ The "Devs" group receives only the two lines of text.
