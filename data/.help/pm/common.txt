👥 *Common Users Scanner Manual*

_This module scans your groups to find users who are members of multiple groups at the same time._
_It is useful for identifying cross-group members, tracking community overlap, or finding people who are in both Group A and Group B._

•════════◄►════════•

*1. Basic Usage (Scan All)*
Scan all groups the bot is currently in to find overlaps.

`.cmn` or `.common`

> • _Explanation:_ The bot compares *every* group it has joined.
> • _Note:_ If you have many groups, this will generate a very large report.

•════════◄►════════•

*2. Comparing Specific Groups*
To avoid scanning everything, you can specify exactly which groups to compare.

`.cmn <Group1>, <Group2>`

> • *Example:* `.cmn jd:Support, jd:Devs`
> • _Explanation:_ Finds users who are present in *both* the "Support" group and the "Devs" group.

•════════◄►════════•

*3. Output Modes (Text vs File)*
By default, the bot sends the list as text messages. If the list is huge, it will spam the chat.

*File Mode (Recommended for big scans)*
Add `-f` to receive the report as a text document instead.

`.cmn -f`

> • *Example:* `.cmn -f jd:all`
> • _Explanation:_ Scans all groups but sends the result as a downloadable file (`.txt`) to keep the chat clean.

•════════◄►════════•

*4. Pro Tips & Advice*
_Scanning large numbers of groups can be slow and produce massive lists._

> • *Avoid Spam:* If you are comparing more than 3 groups, **always use `-f`**.
> • *Be Specific:* Instead of scanning everything (`.cmn`), try comparing just two or three relevant groups at a time to get a shorter, more useful list.
