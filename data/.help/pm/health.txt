🩺 *System Health Monitor Manual*

_This module allows the Bot Owner to view real-time server statistics (RAM, CPU, Disk) and verify the bot's performance._
_It is designed to keep your private chat clean by automatically deleting old reports when a new one is requested._

_Note: This command is restricted to the Bot Owner and Sudo users and works ONLY in Private Chat (PM)._

•════════◄►════════•

*1. Check System Status*
Generate a dashboard showing the current health of the bot's server.

`.health` or `.hlt`

> • _Explanation:_ The bot calculates current memory usage, uptime, and disk space, then sends a detailed report.

•════════◄►════════•

*2. Dashboard Data*
The report provides key technical insights:
> • *Uptime:* How long the bot has been running without a restart.
> • *Memory:* Current RAM usage (useful for detecting leaks).
> • *Disk Usage:* Available storage space on the server.
> • *System:* CPU count and OS information.

•════════◄►════════•

*3. Auto-Clean Feature*
To prevent clogging your private chat with outdated logs, this module has a "self-cleaning" function.

> • _How it works:_
> When you type `.hlt`, the bot looks for the *previous* health report it sent you and deletes it before sending the new one.
> This ensures you always have just *one* up-to-date status card in your chat history.

•════════◄►════════•

*4. Troubleshooting*
> • *No Response?* This command is disabled in groups. You must use it in your private chat with the bot.
> • *Access Denied:* If you are not the Owner or a Sudo user, the bot will simply ignore the command.
