🗑️ *Antidelete & Recovery Manual*

This module acts as a "black box" for your chats. It silently records incoming messages and media. If someone deletes a message (Revoke), the bot immediately recovers it and forwards the deleted content to a secure log channel.

_Note: This command is restricted to the Bot Owner and Sudo users._

✦═════════◆═════════✦

*1. Enable or Disable*
Turn the recording system on or off globally.

`.dlt on` or `.dlt enable`
> • _Explanation:_ Starts recording messages. Any message deleted from now on will be recovered.

`.dlt off`
> • _Explanation:_ Stops recording. Deleted messages will not be recovered.

✦═════════◆═════════✦

*2. Setting the Log Channel (Target)*
By default, recovered messages are sent to the Bot's Private Chat (Saved Messages). You can redirect them to a specific group or channel.

`.dlt <JID>`

> • *Example:* `.dlt 12036302392@g.us`
> • _Explanation:_ Sets the specific group ID as the "Dump Channel". All recovered text and media will be sent there.
> • *Tip:* Use `.dlt clear` to reset the target back to the Bot's Private Chat.

✦═════════◆═════════✦

*3. Checking Status*
View the current configuration to see if it is running and where the logs are going.

`.dlt status` or `.dlt show`

> • _Output:_ Shows `🟢 ON` or `🔴 OFF`, the current Target JID, and storage retention info (usually 3 days).

✦═════════◆═════════✦

*4. How it Works*
> • *Storage:* The bot temporarily saves messages for 3 days. If they are not deleted within that time, they are removed from memory to save space.
> • *Batching:* If a user deletes 10 messages at once, the bot waits a few seconds and sends a single report with all 10 messages to avoid spamming your log channel.
> • *Media:* It recovers Images, Videos, Voice Notes, Stickers, and Documents.
